# Personal Helldivers 2 Mod Manager (phd2mm)

this is phd2mm, not teutinsa's HD2ModManager, which is located here: <br>
https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109 <br>
i apologize for the emptiness here, v1.5 will be added to this repo soon. <br>
update: v1.5 added to repo, transferred/remade app from winforms to wpf. <br>
  i have yet to add readme, app info, standardize/clean up some code. and stuff. <br>
  main functionality is done, barely any testing. once i do, i'll release v1.5. <br>
  if you want to see the readme of old versions, please see the folder <br>
  phd2mm v1.3.1 winforms or phd2mm v1.4 winforms. <br>
  v1.5 wpf is similar to v1.4 but has more indepth customization <br>
  and a few more features, namely right-click to show mod folder path or <br>
  open mod link if valid. also has basic image reading, basically gets <br>
  the first image alphabetically in an associated mod folder with patch file. <br>
  the image in the datagrid/table will have 48x48 resolution image. <br>
  you can hover over the image to see a popup containing 512x512 resolution image <br>
  or close to it. <br>
  visual category is replaced with skin category for consistency, and added a few items. <br>
  
  also, phd2mm app has gnu gpl v3 license, but the PixiEditor ColorPicker is mit license, <br>
  which is why there are 2 licenses. mit license is strictly for the PixiEditor ColorPicker only. <br>
  
  unfortunately, still not compatible with manifest.json because i still don't <br>
  understand how it works, how to read the file and use the information. <br>
  because of this, i do not have plans to integrate manifest.json in the near future. <br>
