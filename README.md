  # Personal Helldivers 2 Mod Manager (phd2mm)
Hello! Welcome to Personal_HD2ModManager v1.5!
This is NOT the famous teutinsa's HD2ModManager, which is in the link below: </br>
https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/109
</br>
This is my own version of a mod manager.
As the name says, I mainly made this mod manager for myself.
Any updates to this program, if there will be any at all, will be infrequent. </br>
I forgot to mention that if your mods are in compressed files such as zip and rar, it won't work with this app,
please uncompress/extract them first so that this app can detect and install mods properly. </br>
Currently no integration with manifest.json files. </br>
Mainly created and tested in Visual Studio 2022,
WPF C# (Formerly in Winforms Visual Basic (VB)), .NET 9 Framework, Windows 10 64-bit / x64. </br>
This application is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. </br>
Feel free to copy, edit, and make your own version of this app! </br>
However, please do not submit changes or edits to this original repository. Instead, fork it and modify your own copy.
There are some screenshots below on how the app looks like. </br>
The information below starting from Table of Contents are also included in "More Info" inside the phd2mm app and README_phd2mmAppInfo.md in this repo. </br>
Anyway, I hope you enjoy using this app! </br>

To download the app, click the Releases which should be on the right. </br>
Or you can just click this link https://github.com/ajaykumar4127/phd2mm/releases and download either the latest version of the app v1.5 for more features
or v1.3.1 if you prefer something simpler and more reliable.

### Known Issues
NOTE: I will only prioritize issues related to core logic / functionality of the app. any visual bugs may be ignored or not prioritized.
-Changing profile specific theme only applies when focus loss/edit end.
-Search bar may be laggy compared to old versions.
-When changing mod order number, it selects the row below it after changing position.
-When changing mod order number, if using a large amount of number like 99999 or more, it does not revert to its original mod order number.
app would lock and prevent certain actions until it returns to a valid number, which is from 0 to the (amount of used mods - 1).
-Clicking any cell then immediately dragging selects both the old cell and the entire row of the dragged row. it should only be the dragged row that is selected.
-Holding control or ctrl button then start dragging row crashes the app. for now, i disabled control/ctrl button when and during drag.
-In UsedMods_DataGrid / Used Mods Table, theres a bug when you click any cell that isnt row header or a cell belonging to Mod Folder Path + Name column,
then you immediately drag a row, both the previously non-row header and non-modfolderpathname cell and the entire dragged row will be selected. logic is still ok.
